It was a commercial success, grossing over $30 million worldwide. It also received positive reviews from critics, who praised its charm, innocence, and originality.
 
You can watch *The Gods Must Be Crazy 2* on DisneyPlus[^3^], where it is available for streaming. You can also rent or buy it from Amazon Prime Video[^1^]. If you are looking for a fun and family-friendly comedy, you should definitely check out this film. You will laugh out loud at the adventures of Xixo and his friends.
  
The film features a talented cast of actors, both professional and amateur. The main character, Xixo, is played by N!xau, a real-life Bushman who was discovered by Uys for the first film. He reprised his role in this sequel, as well as three other films in the series. He brings a natural charm and innocence to his performance, as well as impressive physical skills. His two children, Xiri and Xisa, are played by Eiros and Nadies, who are also real Bushmen.
 
The other main characters are played by Hans Strydom and Lena Farugia, who portray Dr. Stephen Marshall and Dr. Ann Taylor, respectively. They have great chemistry and comedic timing, as they struggle to survive in the desert and deal with their attraction to each other. Erick Raymond Bowen Alfaro and Treasure Tshabalala play Mateo and Timi, the Cuban and Angolan soldiers who are constantly at war with each other. They provide some of the funniest moments in the film, as they try to outsmart and capture each other. Pierre van Pletzen and Lourens Swanepoel play George and \"Big Ben\" Brenner, the elephant poachers who kidnap Xixo's children. They are the villains of the story, but they also have some humorous scenes.
 
The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its charm, innocence, and originality, but also criticized its lack of plot, coherence, and sophistication. It has a 51% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 22 reviews. However, it has a more positive reception from audiences, who enjoyed its humor, adventure, and message. It has a 6.8/10 rating on IMDb based on over 17,000 votes[^2^]. It is widely considered as one of the best comedy films from South Africa.
  
The film also explores the themes of gender, race, and socio-political issues in a humorous way. The film depicts Kate Thompson as the typical western woman from the big city, who is totally out of her element in the Kalahari, and dressed as if she were walking down a Johannesburg street[^2^]. She is contrasted with Xixo's wife, who is content with her simple life and traditional role. Kate also faces sexism from her male colleagues and clients, who underestimate her intelligence and abilities. She eventually finds love and respect with Stephen, who admires her courage and spirit.
 
The film also plays with the stereotypes and prejudices of white and black people in South Africa. The white characters are often portrayed as clumsy, ignorant, or arrogant, while the black characters are shown as wise, resourceful, or friendly. For example, Xixo outsmarts the poachers and saves the day, while Stephen and Kate are constantly in trouble and need his help. The film also mocks the absurdity of war and violence, as Mateo and Timi are constantly fighting each other for no reason, while Xixo tries to make peace with them. The film also shows the contrast between the capitalist government and the communist rebels, who are both corrupt and incompetent.
 
The film's tone is light-hearted and optimistic, despite the serious issues it touches upon. The film uses a lot of physical comedy, such as Xixo's children playing with the poachers' truck, Stephen and Kate's mishaps in the desert, Mateo and Timi's chase scenes, and Xixo's interactions with modern society. The film also uses a lot of irony and satire, such as Xixo's belief that everything is a gift from the gods, the narrator's commentary on Xixo's culture and behavior, and the poachers' ironic fate at the end. The film's message is that happiness and harmony can be achieved by respecting nature, culture, and each other.
